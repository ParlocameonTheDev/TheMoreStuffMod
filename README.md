# The More Stuff Mod
Sequel to the original Stuff Mod, hopefully this time actually finished.

*Including the best items in town, like Corn Dog.*
<br>
Oh and this time the teleporter might actually work.
<br>

### And now:
*How to setup the damn workspace* (basically rewrote [this page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup))
<br>
1. Import the build.gradle (or ```gradlew eclipse``` if you're still a normie) to setup workspace.
2. Get the source files if you wanna search through the code with IDEA/Eclipse using ```gradlew genSources```
3. If you use the chaddiest IntelliJ IDEA, install MinecraftDev [using these instructions](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/MinecraftDev/blob/dev_new/readme.md#installation).
<br>

*How to build the damn thing*
<br>
1. ```gradlew build```
